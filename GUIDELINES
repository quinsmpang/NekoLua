--[[
	Coding Guidelines for this project.
]]--
	
	For Licensing Guidelines, read "LICENSES".
	
	
	Coding Style Guidelines:
		-Generally this: https://github.com/Olivine-Labs/lua-style-guide
			-This list overrides the guidelines in that url, where applicable.
		-Always encode files in UTF-8
		-Use tabs for indentation. 
		-No deprecated Lua functions in patches. Deprecation means removal. This project is future-oriented and legacy code must be purged.
		-Use semicolons! Lua doesn't require this, but DO IT!
		
		
		
		
		
	About MultiOS support:
		This project is primarily developed FOR Unix-like operating systems (*BSDs, Linux)
		Linux-specific patches are to be avoided if possible. Will be accepted if really needed though.
		*BSD-specific patches (excluding OSX) are also to be avoided if possible, but will be accepted
			if really needed.
		
		--[[ Legacy Operating Systems ]] --
		Windows support is a non-issue. Windows can die in a fire. Patches will be rejected.
		OSX support is a non-issue as well. This pathetic piece of shit can die in a fire too. Patches will be rejected.
		
		The code in the repo should be stripped of Windows and OSX parts, if feasible
