        What this project is about: (TODO: Insert vague explanation here...)
                ... Skynet?

	Why Lua?
		Because it's an easy and flexible langage.
		Also, don't you love LuaJIT? :)

	You should instead use X programming language...
		No.
		Lua does the job perfectly.
		The only other language used here is C, and that's for adding functionality to Lua. Also C++ sometimes.

	I don't like the direction this project is going...
		Feel free to fork!

	Why are you licensing this to Public Domain? Aren't you afraid that some evil corporation will steal your code? Why not GPL?
		Nope. It's here for that. Feel free to use the code for any purposes you want.
		As for the GPL: It's too restrictive. It's the cancer and AIDS of licensing.
			Good for certain things (Operating systems), bad for others (libraries, game engines, etc...).
